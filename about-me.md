Hi, I’m Zakaria. I’m a Java Architect, Software developer and technology enthusiast. On this blog I share my ideas and knowledge about the things I encounter in the wild. I’m interested in the tech community, helping people, driving forward new technologies and gaining a deeper understanding of the how everything works. 

The idea of creating **Code Memento** came from a simple problem, it's that I wanted to gather all the code snippets that I use a lot, solutions of issues that I encounter and tricks that I like and that I might forgot. Another motivation was that I explained the same topics every now and then. The solution that I came by is to create a blog with simple and straightforward articles with focus on code.

Throughout my experience I made a lot of Apps and worked with a lot of technologies (*old and new ones*), I worked a lot with :

* **Backend technologies** : Java, Spring, JSF, JPA, EJB, JAX-RS, Struts, etc.
* **Frontend technologies** : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Angular, etc.
* **Cloud technologies** : AWS, S3, Cloudfront, EC2, AWS Lambda, etc.

In **Code Memento**, you'll find many articles that will help you for sure.

If you need anything, you can contact me via my [email](mailto:drissi.zakaria@gmail.com?subject=About%20Code%20Memento&body=Hello%20Zakaria).
