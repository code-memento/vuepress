# Passing the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate

Getting certified in a subject is a great way to validate your knowledge and to prove that you master that subject. Also, a certification can give a great boost to your career and the opportunities that might come to you in the future.

Unfortunately, it's easier said than done. To get certified you need to invest a lot of time and have a lot of patience and persistence because it's not going to be a walk in the park.

In this article, I will share with you my experience and my tactics of how I got the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate** Certification.

## Hack the system vs learn

There are two modes for preparing : Hacking the system and learning.

### Hacking the system

A person might say :

> I did not spend a lot of time on preparation, I passed as many mock exams as I could and read a few articles here and there and that was it.

The main goal of this approach is to understand how the test goes, how the questions are asked, how to guess an answer. The main goal is getting the title, the knowledge is not very important.

### Learning

You spend a lot of time learning and digesting all the aspects of the technology without missing any point.

Every approach has it's pros and cons :

| Hacking the system                      | Learning                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Quick                                   | Slow                                          |
| Learn the minimum                       | Learn and digest almost everything            |
| The knowledge will be forgotten quickly | The knowledge acquired sticks for a long time |

The best approach is to combine the two, and that's what I did. As AWS is a broad subject, it might take a lot of time and practice to master all the services, if you wait until you master everything it might take forever.

## Tactics

You must know that for any certification you must consider these four aspects :

* **Learn** : Read about the subject
* **Practice** : Putting your skills into practice
* **Test** : Passing mock exams
* **Revise** : Study again what you learned

Your planning must take these aspects into consideration.

## Planning

A certification is a real project and it needs budget and time. The *AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate* costs $150 and can take 3 months to prepare.

> What I suggest is to schedule your exam once you start preparing, so you always feel motivated :laughing:

Let's say you want to pass the exam after 3 months, you must plan this period :

* First month : Learn - Practice
* Second month : Learn - Practice - Test
* Third month : Revise - Practice - Test

## Resources I used

Now that you planned your exam, and that you know how to approach it. Here are the resources I used for my preparation :
