# Java Coding Guidelines

## The problem

Code reviews are a good way to spot programming flaws and to avoid problems upfront. Nonetheless, it's a practice that takes time and effort especially if you're dealing with a huge code base.

Luckily, there are static analysis tools like Sonar that provides real-time feedback about the code quality, you can even install plugins in your favourite IDE that will make it easy to correct the violations.

Code reviews and static analysis tools have something in common : **you have to push the code first**. What if the developer can review his own code before pushing it, this way many issues can be avoided upfront.

## The Solution

What if the developer has a checklist with the common best practices and conventions that should be respected ?

Before pushing the code, the developer will check his code against a set of known Java guidelines, this will have many benefits to the team :

* Teaching the team,
* A code review contract,
* A cheap way to improve the overall quality.

The good news is that you don't have to write your own Java Coding Guidelines, I already compiled a set of common issues and best practices into a PDF document that the developer can print and use.
